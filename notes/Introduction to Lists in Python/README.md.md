## 🚀 Features Covered

- Creating lists with numbers and strings
- Accessing list elements by index
- Positive and negative indexing
- List slicing with different ranges and steps
- Membership operators (`in`)
- List comprehensions with conditions and expressions

---

## 📂 Example Code

```python
l = [2, 4, 6]
print(type(l))
print(l)
print(l[:])
print(l[0])
print(l[1])
print(l[2])

colour = ["Red", "Green", "Yellow", "Blue"]
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
print(colour)
print(colour[2])
print(numbers)
print(numbers[5])
print(numbers[len(numbers)-3])
print(numbers[10-3])
print(numbers[2:4])
print(numbers[1:-4])
print(numbers[1:8])
print(numbers[1:8:2])
print(numbers[-3])
print(numbers[7])
