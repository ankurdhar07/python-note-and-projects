# 🎟️ Age & Time Based Ticket System

A simple Python program that calculates the ticket price based on the **user's age** and **time of day**.  
This project demonstrates **conditional statements (`if-elif-else`)** and **user input handling** in Python.

## 📌 Features

- Takes **age** as input.
- Takes **time of day** as input (`Morning`, `Afternoon`, `Evening`).
- Calculates ticket price based on **predefined rules**.
- Displays the price in a user-friendly format.

## 🖥️ How It Works

1. The user enters their **age**.
2. The user specifies the **time of day**.
3. The program checks:
   - If the user is a child, teenager, or adult.
   - What time of day it is.
4. A price is assigned based on both inputs.
5. The ticket price is displayed.
