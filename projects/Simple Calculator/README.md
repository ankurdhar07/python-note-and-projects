## 🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure you have **Python 3** installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository:
   git clone https://github.com/ankurdhar07/python-note-and-projects
Navigate to the project folder:
cd python-note-and-projects

Run the Python script:
python main.py

📜 Code Example:

a = int(input("Enter First Number : "))
b = int(input("Enter Second Number : "))
print("Addition of", a, "and", b, "is :", a + b)
print("Subtraction of", a, "and", b, "is :", a - b)
print("Multiplication of", a, "and", b, "is :", a * b)
print("Division of", a, "and", b, "is :", a / b)
print("Modulus of", a, "and", b, "is :", a % b)
print("Floor Division of", a, "and", b, "is :", a // b)
print("Exponential of", a, "and", b, "is :", a ** b)

💡 Example Output:

Enter First Number : 5
Enter Second Number : 3
Addition of 5 and 3 is : 8
Subtraction of 5 and 3 is : 2
Multiplication of 5 and 3 is : 15
Division of 5 and 3 is : 1.6666666667
Modulus of 5 and 3 is : 2
Floor Division of 5 and 3 is : 1
Exponential of 5 and 3 is : 125
